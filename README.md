## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add immutablebot to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:immutablebot, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure immutablebot is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:immutablebot]]
        end
